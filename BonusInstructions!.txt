So now, all you have to do to keep your bot up is setup something to ping the site your bot made every 5 minutes or so.

Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create an accout if you dont have one.  After verifying your account, click "Add New Monitor".

+ For Monitor Type select "HTTP(s)"
+ In Friendly Name put the name of your bot
+ For your url, put the url of the website you made for your project with "Keep_alive".
+ Select any alert contacts you want, then click "Create Monitor"

Your bot should now be good to go, with near 100% uptime.
